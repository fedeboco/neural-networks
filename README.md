### Using Hopfield Network to clean image noise

Hopfield Networks can be trained with a set of images/data and recognise noisy/modified versions of the same images/data.
Nevertheless, they can get confused if too much noise is applied (see middle column pictures below).

### Using multi-layer perceptron to estimate function output

A multi-layer perceptron can estimate a function's output based on an input and has the potential to make more 
efficient computations on some functions.

### Using Kohonen Network to solve salesman problem

Solving the salesman problem where we need to find the optimal route through all points in a city is a complex task. 
Despite of that, Kohonen Networks can solve the problem pretty fast.
